An Express backend for a Pokemon Nuzlocke tracking app I'm working on. Focusing on expanding my capabilities with `pg-promise`, and once the core of the app is complete I'll use this to expand my knowledge of CI/CD pipeline practices, as well as testing my containerization and deployment capabilities.

I wrote up my setup process in `process.md`.

## Testing

Run ```npm test```

This is a WIP, still under development as of writing this.
